# Composite-ux is a UX experiment.

Can UI components be composed using a Box and layout elements in a heirarchy.

The layout elements only layout their children.

The design system can be started with `npx styleguidist server`

The playroom can be started with `npm run playroom start`

Both can be started together with `npm start`
